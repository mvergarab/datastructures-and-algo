// depth-first search

// we follow the paths of the edges connected to our starting vertex, or search key, one at a time, until we reach the end,
// then we backtrack and search the alternate paths, until we find the vertex we are looking for or we arrive back where we started

// this algo is implemented in either graphs or binary trees so we have to declare it first
